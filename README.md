# Don't Starve Mods
List of all mods I used to make gameplay better. Most of the mods here work for Vanilla and Dlc(RoG,Shipwreck) . I've merged many mods here so some mods can 
change gameplay drastically . It's upto you to disable those in mods menu if u want. 

Installation : Make a 'mods' named folder where launcher.exe is present . Put all these files there . Done !!! If game crashes , try enabling each mod one by one.
